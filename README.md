# Online Security Tools
The idea behind this repository is to have a "library" with online security tools that can be used in incident response and investigations.

Tools are listed per category. Most of them are (completely or partially) free.

Be careful when using some of these tools. You might not want to tip off a possible adversary that its CnC infrastructure or malware has been discovered.
